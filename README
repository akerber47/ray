A really bad ray tracer and rasterizer. Based on Ch 15 of the big graphics book
(Foley et al).  Implemented in (vanilla) Javascript, outputs to an HTML canvas.
Uses my own code for vector calculations, ray-triangle intersections, etc.

Requires Jasmine for unit testing (test.html) to work. Download and install it
manually in the jasmine subdirectory of the source folder. I'm too lazy to
figure out how dependencies really work.
